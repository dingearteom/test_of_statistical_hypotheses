Unions and State Labor Law
================================

Variable Names: 
DENS: 	Percent of public sector employees in unions, 1982 
COMP: 	State bargaining laws cover public employees (1) or not (0) 
RTW: 	State right-to-work law (1) or not (0) 
PVT: 	Percent of private sector employees in unions, 1982 

Number of cases: 50 


Meltz analyzed factors associated with differences in the percent  of public
sector employees belonging to unions by states in the United States and
by provinces in Canada. While he did not run formal regression analyses, 
he finds the major source of difference in public union density to be the 
differences in percent of private sector employees in unions.

The dummy variables for presence of state bargaining laws covering public
employees and presence of state right to work laws in the datafile provide
an opportunity to examine a two-predictor regression involving dummy 
variables. In this case there is interaction between the two dummy 
variables and this calls for interpretation. The interaction variable 
forms a two-way classification table and the regression equation 
estimates the means of the observations in the four cells. 
In the current case the main effect of right-to-work laws is not 
significant, but the interaction with comprehensive state bargaining
laws is. The presence of right-to-work laws is said then to modify the 
relation between unionization and state bargaining laws covering public 
employees. Right-to-work laws would be termed a moderator variable.
